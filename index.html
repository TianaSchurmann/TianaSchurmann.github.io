        This Is Why Your Brain Is So Mesmerized By Visual ASMR
    </div>

    <div class="subh">
        Those ultra-soothing whisper videos have a visual equivalent, and here's how they work.    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        A few years ago, seemingly from the depths of the internet, a buzzword emerged: ASMR. It stands for "autonomous sensory meridian response," an acronym coined by Jennifer Allen in 2010 to describe the tingly, relaxing sensation that many people experience when exposed to certain stimuli, the most common examples being specific soothing sounds like gentle whispering. One MRI study examined the brain activity of people exposed to ASMR and found "significant activation" in brain regions associated with reward and emotional arousal. ASMR exposure also revealed similar brain activity to that of musical frisson (getting literal chills from hearing certain pleasurable sounds or music) and affiliative behaviors (smiling, bonding, pleasing social connection).

    <div class="text">
        This reaction is often described as "brain tingles," and it's not as new as the term may make them seem. "[ASMR] has probably always existed—it's a physiological response," says Craig Richard, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at Shenandoah University in Virginia, founder of ASMR University, and author of Brain Tingles. "There have always been people going to hairdressers getting super-relaxed. There have always been clinicians working with patients giving them benign tingles. But it was YouTube that took that feeling and made it really accessible." It's true: The platform exploded with videos offering these strangely soothing sounds and visuals to help promote sleep and soothe anxiety. ASMR has become a bona fide phenomenon.

        How Nature Awakens a Meditative State

        Reap nature’s meditative benefits: Head outdoors for some all-natural, feel-good vibes.

    <div class="text">
        How long has it been since you spent a day barefoot, grass beneath your feet?
    </div>      
        
    <div class="text">
        Aside from it feeling good—and hey, maybe even tickling a little bit—it’s actually doing you good too. According to research, “walking barefoot in the grass can help decrease anxiety and depression by 62 percent.” So, are you loosening your shoelaces yet?

        Spending time in nature has long been touted for its benefits. Much like meditation, spending time in nature is also linked to a greater sense of happiness. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t find bliss somewhere within nature—at the beach, the desert, in a forest, a park, a farm, or heck—even a backyard. What wouldn’t be so hard to find though? A person who feels they don’t have enough time to get away, be outside, head to the beach, or spend a weekend camping in the woods. According to research by Project Time Off, in 2014 “41 percent of Americans failed to use a total of 429 million days of paid time off.”

        Good vibrations: tapping in to the benefits of ASMR
    </div>

    <div class="subh">
        ASMR, the euphoric tingling certain sounds provoke, has created online superstars with millions of followers. Is it just a weird fad, or could it help people with anxiety and depression?
        </div>

    <div class="text">
        When I was five years old something strange happened. After a busy afternoon finger-painting and running around, we were gathered by our teacher on the classroom carpet to listen to a story. I can’t remember which book she read – only that she began to do so in a soft voice, pitched somewherejust above a whisper.
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        Suddenly, a euphoric, tingling sensation started at the crown of my head and then travelled down my neck and back in waves. The more she read, the stronger the feeling became. I glanced at my friends, expecting to see them in a similar state of rapture, but they weren’t. So I kept the feeling a secret and soon forgot all about it.
    </div> 

    <div class="text">            
        Twenty-five years later, I stumble over an article about a YouTube phenomenon with a ludicrous name – ASMR, short for autonomous sensory meridian response. It describes the exact feeling I remembered having as a child, and claims millions of people around the world are tuning into videos that trigger the same sensation – videos of people speaking softly, scraping their fingers over hair brushes or tearing paper. I do a quick search, and spend the night in a blissful state of deep relaxation.
